# CommonProgramingIssues


this topic is a guide for the beginners

you  may have saw the problem below (check the problem.java file)

<---p.java:5: error: 'void' type not allowed here
    System.out.println(glitch(5));
                         ^
    p.java:9: error: incompatible types: unexpected return value
    return x+3;
        ^
    2 errors
    error: compilation failed

the solution is based on returning a string value and convert it to an integer value (check the solution.java) ... you can run the script and figure out
by yourself
peace :)
